# Review Apps

Review apps are "pre-release" versions of your Dash apps automatically
created by your CI platform when making a pull request.

These apps inherit the configuration options of their production equivalent,
ensuring parity between environments for testing and QA. Review Apps enable you to
quickly deploy and share proposed changes with the rest of your team before
merging them into production.
