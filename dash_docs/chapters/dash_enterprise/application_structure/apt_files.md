## APT files

APT files can be used to install system-level packages via the `apt` package manager.
Supported APT files include the following:

```
apt-packages
dpkg-packages
apt-conf
apt-env
apt-keys
apt-preferences
apt-sources-list
apt-repositories
apt-debconf
```

> If Dash Enterprise is running in an Airgapped network, then it will not
> have access to the public apt repositories. To install apt packages,
> you will need to have an apt mirror within your networked environment.

**apt-packages**

`apt-packages` is an optional text file required when apt packages need to be
installed in the Docker image. This might include database drivers or extra tools
that you might use in Workspaces like `vim` or `nano`.

This file should contain APT packages to install. It accepts multiple packages per
line, and multiple lines.

If this file is included, an `apt-get update` is triggered before installing the packages.
In the following example we are installing `vim`, `unixodbc` and `unixodbc-dev`:

```shell
vim
unixodbc
unixodbc-dev
```

Note that when installing apt-packages from other repositories, you may need to add the repository
to Dash Enterprise â€” this may require you to install additional dependencies and certificates.

As an alternative to including this package, you can also run the `apt-get install`
commands in a `predeploy` script.
See `app.json` section for more details.

**dpkg-packages**

`dpkg-packages/` is an optional _directory_ holding .deb packages to be installed
automatically after apt-packages, apt-repositories and apt-debconf.
Use `dpkg-packages` to install custom packages inside the image.

Packages are installed in lexicographical order. As such, if any packages depend
upon one another, that dependency tree should be figured out beforehand.

```shell
$ ls dpkg-packages/
your-package-0_0.0.1.deb
```

---

**apt-conf**

`apt-conf` is an optional config file for `APT`. This is moved to the folder
`/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99dokku-apt`, and can override any apt.conf files that come
before it in lexicographical order. See [apt.conf Linux man page](https://linux.die.net/man/5/apt.conf) entry for more details.

```
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://user:password@proxy.example.com:8888/";
```

---

**apt-env**

`apt-env` is an optional text file that can contain environment variables.
Note that this is sourced, and should not contain arbitrary code.

```
export ACCEPT_EULA=y
```

---

**apt-keys**

`apt-keys` is an optional text file that can contain a list of urls for apt
repository keys. Each one is installed via `curl "$KEY_URL" | apt-key add -`.
Redirects are not followed. The `sha256sum` of the key contents will be displayed
to allow for key verification.

```
https://packages.example.com/keys/example.asc
```

---

**apt-preferences**

A file that contains [APT Preferences](https://wiki.debian.org/AptConfiguration?action=show&redirect=AptPreferences). This file is not validated for correctness, and is installed to
`/etc/apt/preferences.d/90customizations`.

```json
APT {{
Install-Recommends "false";
}}
```

---

**apt-sources-list**

`apt-sources-list` is an optional text file that overrides the `/etc/apt/sources.list`.
 An empty file may be provided in order to remove upstream packages.

```
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main universe
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-security main universe
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates main universe
deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ bionic-pgdg main
```

---

**apt-repositories**

`apt-repositories` is an optional text file that should contain additional APT
repositories to configure to find packages.

If this file is included, an apt-get update is triggered, and the packages
`software-properties-common` and `apt-transport-https` are installed. Both these
actions happen before any repositories are added.

Requires an empty line at end of file.

```shell
ppa:nginx/stable
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu quantal multiverse

```

---

**apt-debconf**

`apt-debconf`is an optional text file allowing to configure package installation.
Use case is mainly for EULAs (like ttf-mscorefonts-installer).

Requires an empty line at end of file.

```shell
ttf-mscorefonts-installer msttcorefonts/accepted-mscorefonts-eula select true
```
