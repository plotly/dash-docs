    &nbsp;

    We have a collection of sample apps that install common system-level
    dependencies. These applications are _ready to deploy_:

    - [Oracle cx_Oracle Database](https://github.com/plotly/dash-on-premise-sample-app/pull/2)

    You may include a pre-deploy script that executes in

    initialization files in the application folder and then
    copy them into system paths in the pre-deploy script.

    &nbsp;

    ##### Add A Pre-Deploy Script

    Let's generate a file to do this. Note that the file can
    have any name as we must specify the name in an application
    configuration file `app.json`.
    For the purposes of this example we assume we have
    named it `setup_pyodbc` and installed it in the root of our
    application folder.

    Now when the application is deployed, it will install the apt

    In Dash Enterprise, Dash Apps are run in isolated containers.
    Dash Enterprise builds the entire system for each individual app
    from scratch, including installing a fresh instance of Python, installing
    dependencies, and more. This isolation and containerization is great: it
    allows for one app's dependencies to not impact the next app's and,
    from a security perspective, ensures that applications can't modify or
    access the underlying server. One part of this isolation is that each app
    has its own "ephemeral" filesystem. This means that:

    - By default, files that are saved in the app's environment aren't
    persisted across deploys.
    - By default, files (even networked file systems) that are on the actual
    physical server aren't actually accessible to the application.

    &nbsp;

    Starting in Plotly Enterprise 2.5.0, you can map filesystems from the
    underlying server into the application. This allows you to save files
    persistently as well as read files from the underlying server, including
    networked file systems.

    the *Allowed Directories for Mapping* section of the settings page and add the path(s)
    of approved directories.

    it is owned by UID/GID 32767. E.g from the host server, an admin could run

    #### Recommendations

    If you are mounting a filesystem, we have the following recommendations:

    - Try to isolate the data that you need into its own, app-specific folder
    - Do not mount the entire filesystem
    - Do not mount system directories, like those under `/usr`.
    - As per the
    ["Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard),
    folders inside the `/srv` folder would be a good, conventional place
    to host app level data.
    - This feature also works with networked filesystems. Note that this
    requires some extra configuration in the underlying server by your
    server administrator. In particular, the network filesystem should be
    added to the `/etc/fstab` file on the underlying server. For more
    information, see this
    [RHEL7 and CentOS documentation on CIFS and NFS](https://www.certdepot.net/rhel7-mount-unmount-cifs-nfs-network-file-systems/)
    , the official [Ubuntu NFS documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-file-system.html.en),

    In Plotly Enterprise 2.4.0 and above, you can deploy your apps using
    either HTTPS or SSH. If you are deploying with HTTPS, then you do not
    need to set up an SSH key. Thus, you can skip this tutorial and go
    straight to
    <dccLink href="/dash-enterprise/initialize" children="Initialize Dash Apps on Dash Enterprise"/>.

    &nbsp;

    If you are deploying with SSH then you need to add a SSH Key to the
    Dash Enterprise. SSH Keys are used to authenticate your git
    session with the server. Deploying with SSH takes a little bit more
    time to set up but it allows you to deploy without typing in your
    username and password each time. Continue below for instructions on
    how to generate and add a SSH Key.

    #### Why Deploy with SSH?

    We recommend deploying with HTTPS for most of our users. However, there
    are a few cases where deploying with SSH is advantageous:

    - If your Dash Enterprise is using a **self-signed certificate**,
    deploying with HTTPS
    [requires some extra, challenging configuration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11621768/).
    In these cases, it will be easier to configure deployment using SSH.
    - If your Dash Enterprise is configured with **SAML**, then the
    HTTPS method will not work.
    - If you are experiencing connectivity issues due to network latency, consider deploying with SSH instead; this method is often less susceptible to timeouts than HTTP, and so may provide a more reliable means of deploying your app.
    deploying with HTTP

    #### Already Have an SSH Key?

    If you already have an SSH key that you've used in other
    services, you can use that key instead of generating a new one.
    For instructions on how to add an existing SSH Key to Dash Enterprise,
    scroll down to **Copy and Add SSH Key**.

    If you have previously deployed your Dash app to your Dash Enterprise,

    `dash-enterprise-auth` includes the method `create_logout_button` which allows you to

    `get_username`, `get_user_data` and `get_kerberos_ticket_cache` (only applicable for
    certain server configurations), which provide information about the app's viewer and so
    must be called from within callbacks.

    The example below demonstrates how to use these callbacks. Note that in order to use

    tarballs or (2) using environment variables.

    ***

    #### Using Tarballs

    To add private python packages to a Dash App using tarballs, you need to
    include the `tar.gz` file in your App's root folder. For example,

    #### Using Environment Variables

    As of `pip==10.0.0`, it is possible to use environment variables within

    #### Create and Link (via UI)

    You can create one Redis instance that is used by multiple apps or you

    To start, we recommend creating a unique Redis Database for each
    Dash App. It will be easier for you to ensure that one application doesn't
    override the data from a separate application.

    **1.** Create a database before initializing an app.

    **2.** Create and link a database after an app has been initialized.

    ##### Create a Database Before Initializing an App

    If you haven't initialized an app yet, select **Databases** situated in the
    top navigation menu. Next, select **Create Database**, then in the
    'Create Database' modal, add the name of your database. We recommend using
    a convention like using the name of your application and adding `-redis`
    to the end, e.g. `my-dash-app-redis`.

    Once your Redis Database has been created, you'll notice that it is
    added to your list of databases.

    #### Using Redis inside Workspaces

    Dash Enterprise Workspaces share the same Redis instance as the deployed
    application.
    This enables you to inspect data of your Redis instances from within
    workspaces. However, it is important that you structure your code to
    not override Redis data.

    Each Redis instance has 16 available databases.

    `dash-snapshots` implicitly uses an alternative Redis database on the
    same instance.

    The Sample Applications & Templates demonstrate how to use an alternative
    Redis database if within the Workspace environment:

    ```
    if os.environ.get("DASH_ENTERPRISE_ENV") == "WORKSPACE":
        next_database_number = str((int(os.environ.get("REDIS_URL")[-1]) + 1) % 16)
        REDIS_URL = os.environ["REDIS_URL"][:-1] + next_database_number
        parsed_url = urlparse(os.environ.get("REDIS_URL"))
        if parsed_url.path == "" or parsed_url.path == "/":
            i = 0
        else:
            try:
                i = int(parsed_url.path[1:])
            except:
                raise Exception("Redis database should be a number")
        parsed_url = parsed_url._replace(path="/{}".format((i + 1) % 16))

        updated_url = parsed_url.geturl()
        REDIS_URL = "redis://%s" % (updated_url.split("://")[1])
    else:
        REDIS_URL = os.environ.get("REDIS_URL", "redis://127.0.0.1:6379")

    To get started, see the [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/documentation)
    to download Redis and set up a local instance.

    &nbsp;

    By referencing Redis in our code, we'll need to add the variable to our

        The Dash Enterprise platform has an API endpoint for creating PDF exports
        of your Dash applications. The API is simple: pass in the URL of your
        Dash app and the sizing parameters and get back a PDF print out. You can
        automate PDF generation with
        <dccLink
            children="Dash Enterprise's Celery task queues"
            href="/dash-enterprise/celery-process"
        />
        or you can generate these PDFs on-the-fly.

        This API endpoint is used by the Dash Enterprise Snapshot Engine library.
        Refer to the
        [Snapshot Engine documentation](https://plotly.com/dash/snapshot-engine/)
        for more examples.

        - `url` - The URL to download
        - `appname` - Your app's name.
        - `secret_key` - Your app's secret key. This is needed for authorizing the pdf generation.
        - `wait_selector` - A string that specifies a
        [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Simple_selectors).
        The API will wait until an element that matches this CSS selector
        appears on the screen before taking a screenshot. This ensures that
        the page has finished loading before taking a screenshot.
        In general, we recommend:
          - If there are no graphs on the page, then embed an
          `html.Div(id='waitfor')` in your `app.layout` or return it from
          the callback that gets executed last. With the id `waitfor`, the
          `wait_selector` would be `"#waitfor"`.
          - If the page has `dcc.Graph` elements on it, then you'll want
          to wait until these graphs have finished renderering. To do this,
          set the `wait_selector` to be `#graph_id .svg-container` where
          `"graph_id"` corresponds to the ID of the `dcc.Graph` component.
          `.svg-container` refers to a CSS class of an element that plotly
          inserts in the graph when it has finished rendering.
        - `pdf_options` - PDF sizing options. These options are similar to the
        options that you see when you print a web page using your web browser.
        They include:
          - `pageSize`: Predefined page size of the generated PDF. Available options:
            `A3`, `A4`, `A5`, `Legal`, `Tabloid`. Custom page sizes can be
            provided with the top level `page_size` property (see below).

          - `marginsType`: Specifies the type of margins to use. `0` for
            default margin, `1` for no margin, and `2` for minimum margin. We
            recommend using `1` and controlling the margins yourself through
            your app's CSS.
          - `landscape` (optional): `True` for landscape, `False` for portrait.
          - 'page_size' (optional): A dict specifying `width` & `height`
          in microns, e.g. {'width': 296700, 'height': 209900}.

        #### Basic Example

        This example provides a simple UI around the PDF API. You can run this
        example locally or you can deploy this example to Dash Enterprise.
        A few things to note:

         - If you're testing locally, you will have to specify default values for your
        DASH_DOMAIN_BASE, DASH_APP_NAME and DASH_SECRET_KEY. You can find them in the list of your app's
        environment variables. See <dccLink href="/dash-enterprise/environment-variables" children="our doc on environment variables"/>

    ## Managing Connection Drivers and Libraries

    Dash Apps can use open source libraries to query external databases and datastores in callbacks or job queues.

    The Python DB-API standardizes the interface for most Python database access modules. This allows us to write Dash
    apps with code that can be modified with little effort to connect to different types of databases with different dialects
    by following the standardized API. For more information on the Python DB-API, see [PEP-0249](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/).

    To query databases, you'll need to install the Python database packages and in many cases system level dependencies.
    For complete examples, see the relevant "Database Connections" section in Sample Apps & Templates:

    * Connecting to PostgreSQL
    * Connecting to MSSQL with pyodbc
    * Connecting to MySQL
    * Connecting to Oracle Express
    * Connecting to Databricks Cluster
    * Connecting to Dask Cluster

    ## Working with Connection Objects in a Dash App

    Many of the database apps follow a similar pattern:

    1. Install the database driver & system level dependencies. This will vary by database type and we recommend viewing
    the examples that we've provided first. Many of the database drivers more easily installed on Linux environments,
    and so we recommend developing these apps in a [Dash Enterprise Workspace](https://plotly.com/dash/workspaces/).

    2. Create a connection. We recommend using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) if available for your database.

    3. Store your connection's database password as an environment variable in your App Settings in the Dash Enterprise
    App Manager instead of storing it within code.

    4. Test that the database server has started successfully, verify that it is accepting connections, and validate the credentials and connection string; we can create a simple
    `try_connection` function which sends a basic query to the database and checks to see if it is successful. If it fails,
    the connection is retried after an exponentially increasing delay. This allows us to distinguish between errors
    arising from issues with the callback logic, and errors caused by database configuration or connectivity problems. Eg:
    ```
    @retry(wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=2, min=1, max=10), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))
    def try_connection():
        try:
            with postgres_engine.connect() as connection:
                stmt = text("SELECT 1")
                connection.execute(stmt)
            print("Connection to database successful.")

        except Exception as e:
            print("Connection to database failed, retrying.")
            raise Exception
    ```

    5. Consider [connection pooling](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/pooling.html#using-connection-pools-with-multiprocessing-or-os-fork).
    In these examples above, we don't use database connection pools. Connection pools have tricky implications when using
    alongside `celery` or gunicorn's `--preload` option. If you aren't using `--preload` nor `celery`, then you can improve
    your query performance by using a node pool. With a node pool, connections are shared instead of recreated and discarded.
    It is possible to use --preload and celery with a node pool but it requires extra caution. For more details, see:
    > - [SQLAlchemy: Using Connection Pools with Multiprocessing or os.fork()](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/pooling.html#using-connection-pools-with-multiprocessing-or-os-fork)
    > - [Not The Same Pre-fork Worker Model](https://www.yangster.ca/post/not-the-same-pre-fork-worker-model/)
    > - [SQLAlchemy connection pool within multiple threads and processes](https://davidcaron.dev/sqlalchemy-multiple-threads-and-processes/)

    To disable connection pooling, you will use the `NullPool`:
    ```
    from sqlalchemy.pool import NullPool
    engine = create_engine(
        'postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@localhost/test',
        pool=NullPool)
    ```

    6. Construct your SQL query. You have several options here:
        * Use raw SQL commands. This is the low-level option and great if you want full control & transparency and are
        comfortable with SQL. We recommend using the [`text`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text)
        function in `sqlalchemy` and parameterized queries. This will avoid SQL Injection issues:
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        from sqlalchemy import text

        t = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=:user_id")
        result = pd.read_sql(t, params={'user_id': 12})
        ```
        * Use the Pythonic classes available with `sqlalchemy`. For  examples, see [SQLAlchemy — Python Tutorial
        ](https://towardsdatascience.com/sqlalchemy-python-tutorial-79a577141a91).

        *; Use [ibis](https://ibis-project.org), a library that uses SQLAlchemy under the hood but has a more Pandas-like interface.

    7. Open a connection when you need to perform an operation and close it after. In `sqlalchemy`, this can be done with the `with engine.connect()` clause.
    While a NullPool can do this for us by default as well, we can also use the Engine object to implicitly open and close connections
    on an ad hoc basis for both this and other pooling implementations. Enclosed in the `with`context statement, the
    connection object generated by the `Engine.connect()` method is automatically closed by `Connection.close()` at the
    end of the codeblock e.g.
    ```python
    with mssql_engine.connect() as connection:
         countries = pd.read_sql('SELECT DISTINCT location from data', connection)
    ```

    ## Database URLs

    As we saw earlier when creating our SQLAlchemy engine object, a database URL is required to be passed to specify the
    dialect and driver we will use to connect to our database. This can be passed to the pool or directly to the Engine
    object to use a default pool.
    ```
    dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database

    # For PostgreSQL
    postgres+psycopg2://username:password@localhost:8050/test-database
    ```
    For more information on dialects and drivers, see [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#database-urls).

        Troubleshooting Checklist

        1. Search for your error message on this page.
        2. Verify that you can deploy a sample application or template.
        3. Verify the Dash Enterprise-specific files required for deployment like requirements.txt & Procfile. <dccLink href="/dash-enterprise/application-structure" children="View a full list of these files"/>.
        4. Verify that the requirements & versions listed in the App Manager for your application match your expectations and what you have specified in your requirements.txt file. The requirements listed in the App Manager represent the exact versions being used in the application that is currently deployed.
        5. Try running your application in a Workspace.
        6. Try deploying your application from a Workspace. In Workspaces, git & ssh are preconfigured so running `git push plotly master` should "just work".
        7. Reach out to our <dccLink href="/dash-enterprise/support" children="support team"/> with the error that you encountered when doing a `git push plotly master`.

        The following is a collection of common error messages when running `git push`.

        To resolve get the name of your current
        branch by running `git branch`. Then, to push from this branch
        to the remote server, run `git push plotly your-branch-name:master`.

        This may also occur if you don’t have a `requirements.txt` file.

        The buildpack is the technology Dash Enterprise uses to create a Docker container.

        Dash Enterprise supports three different buildpacks: The standard Python & pip buildpack, a Python & conda buildpack, and a Dash for R buildpack. Dash Enterprise automatically selects the buildpack based off of which files are contained in the project:\

        - `requirements.txt` - If this file exists, then Dash Enterprise uses the Python & pip buildpack.
        - `conda-requirements.txt` - If this file exists, then Dash Enterprises uses the Python & conda buildpack.
        - `.buildpacks` - If this file exists and is equal to `https://github.com/plotly/heroku-buildpack-r#heroku-18`, then Dash Enterprise uses the R buildpack.

        Above, you can see the output of the debugging logs where unimportant lines
        have been commented out or omitted. Check the first uncommented out line in the sample
        output above to ensure that the domain is your Dash server's domain and that port is 3022.
        If it isn't, you will need to update your `~/.ssh/config` file to set the
        correct port.

        The next two emphasized lines show the public keys that were offered (and
        in this case rejected) by the server. If the RSA key that you added to
        Dash Enterprise is not among those offered you will need to add it to your `ssh-agent`
        with `ssh-add ~/path/to/your/key`.

        See <dccLink href="/dash-enterprise/ssh" children="SSH"/> page for more details on `ssh-agent`

        This happens when multiple user push changes to the same app.
        Dash Enterprise does not support collaborative deploys or changes being pushed to an app by multiple users.
        You have three options to work deploy apps collaboratively:

        1. Only the app owner and admin users can deploy to the application. If you are given admin rights you will be able to deploy changes to the app as well.
        2. Pushing via [ssh deploy method](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-enterprise/ssh) after adding your ssh key to the app owner's account.For this method to work, you must create a separate ssh key specifically for the other users account. If you upload the same key to two different users, then Dash Enterprise will not know which user is deploying and will complain and say you don't have permission.
        3. Pushing the master branch from the repository with the app owner's credentials after setting up a CI pipeline working in a repository.

        If deploying with SSH, then this can happen when your `~/.ssh/config` is improperly configured. See  <dccLink href="/dash-enterprise/ssh" children="SSH"/> page for more details.

        If deploying with HTTPS, then this can happen if your username or password is incorrect. Note that usernames and passwords in Dash Enterprise are case sensitive; e.g. the username `Chris.Parmer` is different than the username `chris.parmer`.

        Git can sometimes cache these usernames after you've typed them. Run `$ git config credential.helper` to verify and correct the username.

        Also, some operating system's password managers can cache usernames as well. Open your operating system's password manager and verify the username & password if you are deploying with `https`, running into access denied errors, and `git` isn't asking you for your username and password.

        This error can happen if you are using a version of `git` that
        is incompatible with Dash Enterprise's `git` server.
        In `git` `v2.26`, `git` switched the default transport protocol
        to Version 2. Dash Enterprise's git server runs on `git` 2.17.1
        and it only supports version `0`.

        According to the git documentation,
        the server and client are supposed to be able to negotiate the
        protocol but, for some as of yet unknown reason, this does not work
        when deploying with `https`.

        To fix, manually configure `git` to use the old protocol,
        either in the operation itself:

        ```
        $ git -c protocol.version=0 git clone https://<dash-enterprise-server/GIT/<dash-app-name>
        ```

        or globally:

        ```
        git config --global protocol.version 0
        ```

        **This error can also happen if you forgot to add the ~/.ssh/config entry.** 
        It should resemble:

        ```
        Host <dash-enterprise-server>
            Port 3022
        ```

        This can happen if the directives listed in `DOKKU_SCALE` don't match

        `DOKKU_SCALE`
        ```
        web=1
        worker=1
        ```

        In this case, `DOKKU_SCALE` is asking Dash Enterprise to run the "web"
        process and the "worker" process in their own container.
        However, there is no associated command for the "worker" process in the
        `Procfile`.

        To resolve, make sure that the directives (e.g. `web`, `worker`) in the `Procfile` & `DOKKU_SCALE`
        match.

        See <dccLink href="/dash-enterprise/application-structure" children="application structure"/>

        This can happen if there is an error when Dash Enterprise attempts to

        application code.

        To diagnose, try running the `web` command listed
        in the `Procfile` either locally or within a Dash Enterprise Workspace.

        Also, verify that your development environment matches the production
        environment. Using a Dash Enterprise Workspace is a great way to
        ensure that your environment will match since it has the same build
        process (it will build the packages listed in `requirements.txt`),
        the same network, and the same operating system.

        This can happen in the following scenarios:


        * Your app takes longer than 30 seconds to start — 

        In this scenario, the `gunicorn` `web` process does not have enough 
        time to complete its task during the booting process. By default, 
        `gunicorn` has a 30 second timeout. Workers silent for more than this 
        many seconds are killed and restarted. 


        To resolves, we recommend that you first use the `--preload` flag to reduce your 
        application's memory consumption and speed up boot time. Avoid the `--preload` 
        flag if you are using shared database connection pools. See 
        [Gunicorn Docs on Preloading](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/settings.html#preload-app) 
        for more details. 


        ```
        web: gunicorn app:server --workers 4 --preload
        
        ```
    

        Use the `--timeout` flag only if you cannot use the `--preload` flag. 
        `--timeout` allows you to modify the default amount of time available 
        for your workers to complete  a task. See 
        [Gunicorn Docs on Timeout](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#timeout)
        for details.


        ```
        web: gunicorn app:server --workers 4 --timeout 90

        ```
  

        * Your app's callbacks take more than 30 seconds to finish — 

        To resolve, consider using a background job queue with the Dash 
        Enterprise Snapshot Engine. 

        Alternatively, increase this timeout and ask 
        your server admin to increase the timeout setting in the Dash Enterprise 
        Server Manager. We recommend using a job queue instead of increasing 
        the timeouts because it will make your application more scalable.

        This may occur because Dash Enterprise maps `/etc/ssl/certs` from the host server to 
        Dash apps to make it possible to install APT packages from non-standard APT repositories
        by default. This interfere with installing certain packages. A server configuration 
        option to turn this feature off is available. See APT files section in 
        [Application Structure chapter](/dash-enterprise/application-structure) 
        for more details.

        To resolve, an admin user can login to your-dash-instance:8800/settings, check 
        "Enable Dash Customizations" at the bottom of the page and then check 
        "Indirect Certificate Mapping". They would then save and restart the 
        server to enable the change. That would prevent you from seeing this

    #### Deploying Changes

    By default, Dash apps run on `localhost` - you can only access them on
    your local machine. To share a Dash app, you need to "deploy" your Dash app
    to the Dash Enterprise platform. This can be achieved via a series of
    commands. Namely,

    - `git status` allows you to view which files have been changed.
    - `git diff` prints out changes within the files.
    - `git add .` will add all your changes.
    - `git commit -m "a description of the changes"` will commit you changes.
    - `git push <repository-name> master` will deploy your code to
    Dash Enterprise.

    `git status` and `git diff` are optional and are only required if you
