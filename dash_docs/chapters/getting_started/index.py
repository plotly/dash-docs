    Dash apps are composed of two parts. The first part is the "`layout`" of
    the app and it describes what the application looks like.
    The second part describes the interactivity of the application and will be

    Dash provides Python classes for all of the visual components of
    the application. We maintain a set of components in the
    `dash_core_components` and the `dash_html_components` library
    but you can also [build your own](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate)
    with JavaScript and React.js.

    Note:

    1. The `layout` is composed of a tree of "components" like `html.Div`
        and `dcc.Graph`.
    2. The `dash_html_components` library has a component for every HTML
        tag. The `html.H1(children='Hello Dash')` component generates
        a `<h1>Hello Dash</h1>` HTML element in your application.
    3. Not all components are pure HTML. The `dash_core_components` describe
        higher-level components that are interactive and are generated with
        JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library.
    4. Each component is described entirely through keyword attributes.
        Dash is _declarative_: you will primarily describe your application
        through these attributes.
    5. The `children` property is special. By convention, it's always the
        first attribute which means that you can omit it:
        `html.H1(children='Hello Dash')` is the same as `html.H1('Hello Dash')`.
        Also, it can contain a string, a number, a single component, or a
        list of components.
    6. The fonts in your application will look a little bit different than
        what is displayed here. This application is using a
        custom CSS stylesheet to modify the default styles of the elements.
        You can learn more in the <dccLink href="/external-resources" children="css tutorial"/>,
        but for now you can initialize your app with

    ```
    external_stylesheets = ['https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css']

    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)
    ```
    to get the same look and feel of these examples.

    ### Making your first change

    **New in dash 0.30.0 and dash-renderer 0.15.0**

    Dash includes "hot-reloading", this features is activated by default when
    you run your app with `app.run_server(debug=True)`. This means that Dash
    will automatically refresh your browser when you make a change in your code.

    Give it a try: change the title "Hello Dash" in your application or change the `x` or the `y` data. Your app should auto-refresh with your change.

    > Don't like hot-reloading? You can turn this off with `app.run_server(dev_tools_hot_reload=False)`.
    > Learn more in <dccLink href="/devtools" children="Dash Dev Tools documentation"/> Questions? See the [community forum hot reloading discussion](https://community.plotly.com/t/announcing-hot-reload/14177).

    #### More about HTML

    The `dash_html_components` library contains a component class for every
    HTML tag as well as keyword arguments for all of the HTML arguments.

    '''),

    rc.Syntax(examples['getting_started_layout_2.py'][0], summary='''
        Let's customize the text in our app by modifying the inline styles of the
        components. Create a file named `app.py` with the following code:
        '''),

    html.Div(examples['getting_started_layout_2.py'][1], className="example-container", style={
        'padding-right': '35px',
        'padding-bottom': '30px'
    }),



    rc.Markdown('''
        In this example, we modified the inline styles of the `html.Div`
        and `html.H1` components with the `style` property.

        `html.H1('Hello Dash', style={'textAlign': 'center', 'color': '#7FDBFF'})`
        is rendered in the Dash application as
        `<h1 style="text-align: center; color: #7FDBFF">Hello Dash</h1>`.

        There are a few important differences between the `dash_html_components`
        and the HTML attributes:

        1. The `style` property in HTML is a semicolon-separated string. In Dash,
           you can just supply a dictionary.
        2. The keys in the `style` dictionary are [camelCased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
           So, instead of `text-align`, it's `textAlign`.
        3. The HTML `class` attribute is `className` in Dash.
        4. The children of the HTML tag is specified through the `children` keyword
           argument. By convention, this is always the _first_ argument and
           so it is often omitted.


        Besides that, all of the available HTML attributes and tags are available
        to you within your Python context.

        #### Reusable Components

        By writing our markup in Python, we can create complex reusable
        components like tables without switching contexts or languages.

        #### More about Visualization

        The `dash_core_components` library includes a component called `Graph`.

        `Graph` renders interactive data visualizations using the open source
        [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) JavaScript graphing
        library. Plotly.js supports over 35 chart types and renders charts in
        both vector-quality SVG and high-performance WebGL.

        The `figure` argument in the `dash_core_components.Graph` component is
        the same `figure` argument that is used by `plotly.py`, Plotly's
        open source Python graphing library.
        Check out the [plotly.py documentation and gallery](https://plotly.com/python)
        to learn more.

        it can be tedious to write your copy in HTML.

        `dash_core_components` library. Create a file named `app.py` with the following code:

        ### Summary

        The `layout` of a Dash app describes what the app looks like.
        The `layout` is a hierarchical tree of components.
        The `dash_html_components` library provides classes for all of the HTML
        tags and the keyword arguments describe the HTML attributes like `style`,
        `className`, and `id`.
        The `dash_core_components` library generates higher-level
          components like controls and graphs.
