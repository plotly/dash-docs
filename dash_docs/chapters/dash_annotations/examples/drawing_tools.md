In the example below, we add all the available drawing tools to the modebar, so that you can inspect the characteristics of drawn shapes for the different types of shapes: rectangles, circles, lines, closed and open paths.

Rectangles, circles or ellipses and lines are all defined by their bounding-box rectangle, that is by the coordinates of the start and end corners of the rectangle, `x0`, `y0`, `x1` and `y1`.

As for paths, open and closed, their geometry is defined as an [SVG path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).
