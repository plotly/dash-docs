    This brings along three component libraries
    that make up the core of Dash: `dash_html_components`, `dash_core_components`,
    `dash_table`, as well as the `plotly` graphing library. These libraries are
    under active development, so install and upgrade frequently.

    These docs are running `dash` version `{}`.
    Python 2 and 3 are supported.

    We also recommend installing [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which is
    required by [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) and
    used in many of our examples.
