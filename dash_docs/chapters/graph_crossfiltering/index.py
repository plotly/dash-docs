    The `dash_core_components` library includes a component called `Graph`.

    `Graph` renders interactive data visualizations using the open source
    [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) JavaScript graphing
    library. Plotly.js supports over 35 chart types and renders charts in
    both vector-quality SVG and high-performance WebGL.

    The `figure` argument in the `dash_core_components.Graph` component is
    the same `figure` argument that is used by `plotly.py`, Plotly's
    open source Python graphing library.
    Check out the [plotly.py documentation and gallery](https://plotly.com/python)
    to learn more.

    Dash components are described declaratively by a set of attributes.
    All of these attributes can be updated by callback functions, but only
    a subset of these attributes are updated through user interaction, such as
    when you click on an option in a `dcc.Dropdown` component and the
    `value` property of that component changes.

    The `dcc.Graph` component has four attributes that can change
    through user-interaction: `hoverData`, `clickData`, `selectedData`,
    `relayoutData`.
    These properties update when you hover over points, click on points, or
    select regions of points in a graph.

    ### Current Limitations

    There are a few limitations in graph interactions right now.
    - It is not currently possible to customize the style of the hover
      interactions or the select box.
      This issue is being worked on in [https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/1847](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/1847).

    ***

    There's a lot that you can do with these interactive plotting features.
    If you need help exploring your use case, open up a thread in the
    [Dash Community Forum](https://community.plotly.com/c/dash).

    ***

    The next chapter of the Dash User Guide explains how to share data between
    callbacks.
