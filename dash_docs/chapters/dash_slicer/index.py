    # Introduction to Dash Slicer

    The ``dash_slicer`` library provides an easy way to visualize 3D image data
    by slicing along one dimension. Multiple views on the same data can be linked,
    to help with navigation. There is also support for mask overlays.

    Install Dash Slicer with:

    ```pip install -U dash-slicer```

    The source is on GitHub at [plotly/dash-slicer](https://github.com/plotly/dash-slicer).

    ## Guide

    ### A first example

    Let's get started with a simple example.
    (The examples on this page are built with dash-slicer version {dash_slicer.__version__})
    '''),

    rc.Markdown(
        examples['slicer_example1.py'][0],
        style=styles.code_container
    ),
    html.Div(examples['slicer_example1.py'][1], className='example-container'),

    rc.Markdown('''
    In the code above, we first load a 3D numpy array (a volumetric image). Then
    we instantiate a `VolumeSlicer` object with that data. This object is not
    a Dash component, but has attributes that are. We place its `graph` and
    `slider` in the layout, as well as a handful of `Store` components that the
    slicer needs to function.

    The graph's `scrollZoom` config option is turned off here, because
    it would make the plot grab scroll events as you scroll down this page.

    If the server is run in debug mode, consider setting `dev_tools_props_check`
    to False, because it has a big impact on the performance.

    ### Multiple slicers

    In the next example, we create multiple slicers, one for each dimension,
    and put them in a layout, just like we did in the previous example.
    '''),

    rc.Markdown(
        examples['slicer_example2.py'][0],
        style=styles.code_container
    ),
    html.Div(examples['slicer_example2.py'][1], className='example-container'),

    rc.Markdown('''
    You can see how each view contains indicator lines, which show the
    position of the other slicers. Each slicer has a certain color
    (which is auto-selected, but can also be provided), which is shown
    in the corners around the image. The same color is used to draw the
    slicer's indicator lines in the other views.

    Slicers indicate each-other's position if they are linked based on their
    `scene_id`. This is a property that can be provided when you
    instantiate a `VolumeSlicer`. By default, the `scene_id` is derived
    from the volume. That's why the linking in this example works: each
    slicer is given the same numpy array object. By explicitly setting
    the `scene_id`, multiple views on different data (e.g. MRI and CT) can
    be linked as well.

    In addition to using the sliders, you can click in one of the
    views to make the other views go to the clicked location. Try it!
    Thanks to this navigation mode, you can optionally hide sliders in
    the layout when two or more views are present (see the `VolumeSlicer.slider`
    property ).

    ### Anisotropic data

    In the next example, we make the data non-isotropic. This means
    that the distance between voxels is not equal for all dimensions.
    The voxel-spacing can be provided via the `spacing` argument.
    Similarly, an `origin` can also be provided. You can zoom into the
    view on the right to see that the voxels are elongated.
    '''),

    rc.Markdown(
        examples['slicer_example3.py'][0],
        style=styles.code_container
    ),
    html.Div(examples['slicer_example3.py'][1], className='example-container'),

    rc.Markdown('''

    ### Reacting to the slicer state

    This example illustrates how your application can react to the slicer's
    position and view by using the `state` store as an input. Note that the
    id of this store is a dict, which makes it possible to write a
    [pattern matching Input](https://dash.plotly.com/pattern-matching-callbacks)
    to collect the states of all slicers with a certain scene_id.
    See the reference docs for details.
