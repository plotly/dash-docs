    ## Embedding a Dash app within an Existing Flask App

    As discussed in the <dccLink href="/deployment" children="Deployment Chapter"/>, Dash uses the Flask
    web framework under the hood. This makes it fairly straightforward to
    embed a Dash app at a specific route of an existing Flask app.

    In the following example, a Dash app is mounted at the `/dash` route (eg
    `http://localhost:8050/dash`) of a Flask app:

        @server.route('/')
        def index():
            return 'Hello Flask app'

    ## Combining One or More Dash Apps with Existing WSGI Apps

    This approach uses Werkzeug's

    Flask). It is useful when you want to combine multiple Dash apps or when
