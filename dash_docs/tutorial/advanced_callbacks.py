    ## Catching errors with `PreventUpdate`

    In certain situations, you don't want to update the callback output. You can

    ## Determining which `Input` has fired with `dash.callback_context`

    In addition to event properties like `n_clicks`
    that change whenever an event happens (in this case a click), there is a
    global variable `dash.callback_context`, available only inside a callback.
    It has properties:
    - `triggered`: list of changed properties. This will be empty on initial
      load, unless an `Input` prop got its value from another initial callback.
      After a user action it is a length-1 list, unless two properties of a
      single component update simultaneously, such as a value and a timestamp
      or event counter.
    - `inputs` and `states`: allow you to access the callback params
      by id and prop instead of through the function args. These have the form
      of dictionaries `{ 'component_id.prop_name': value }`

    Here's an example of how this can be done:'''),

    ### Legacy behaviour: using timestamps

    Prior to v0.38.0, you needed to compare timestamp properties like
    `n_clicks_timestamp` to find the most recent click. While existing uses of
    `*_timestamp` continue to work for now, this approach is deprecated, and
    may be removed in a future update. The one exception is
    `modified_timestamp` from `dcc.Store`, which is safe to use, it is NOT
    deprecated.

    ## Improving performance with memoization

    Memoization allows you to bypass long computations by storing the

    To better understand how memoization works, let's start with a simple example.
