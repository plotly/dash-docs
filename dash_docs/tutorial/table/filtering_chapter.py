        # DataTable Filtering

        As discussed in the [interactivity chapter](), `DataTable` includes
        filtering capabilities. Users can turn on filtering options by defining
        the `filtering` attribute. `filter_action='native'` will initiate clientside
        (front-end) filtering. Alternatively you can specify `filter_action='native'`.
        If the DataTable is quite large, clientside filtering will likely
        become slow. Using the back-end filtering option: `filter_action='custom'`
        will allow serverside filtering.

        ## Filtering Syntax

        To filter on a column you can enter either an operator and a value
        (for example `> 5000`) or just a value (`5000`) to use the default
        operator for that column's data type.

        Simple strings can be entered plain:
        - `= Asia` in the "continent" column
        - `B` in the "country" column matches all countries that contain a
          capital B

        But if you have spaces or special characters (including `-`,
        particularly in dates)  you need to wrap them in quotes.
        Single quotes `'`, double quotes `"`, or backticks `` ` `` all work.
        - `= "Bosnia and Herzegovina"`
        - `>='2008-12-01'`

        If you have quotes in the string, you can use a different quote, or
        escape the quote character. So `eq 'Say "Yes!"'` and
        `="Say \\"Yes!\\""` are the same.

        Numbers can be entered plain (previously they needed to be wrapped in
        `num()`):
        - `> 5000` in the "gdpPercap" column
        - `< 80` in the `lifeExp` column

        ## Operators

        Many operators have two forms: a symbol (`=`) and a word (`eq`) that
        can be used interchangeably.

        ## Back-end Filtering

        For large dataframes, you can perform the filtering in Python instead
        of the default clientside filtering. You can find more information on
        performing operations in python in the
        [Python Callbacks chapter](/datatable/callbacks).

        The syntax is (now) the same as front-end filtering, but it's up to the
        developer to implement the logic to apply these filters on the Python
        side.
        In the future we may accept any filter strings, to allow you to
        write your own expression query language.

        > Note: we're planning on adding a structured query object
        > to make it easier and more robust to manage back-end filter logic.
