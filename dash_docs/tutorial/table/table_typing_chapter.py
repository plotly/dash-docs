    '''
    ### Typing
    The DataTable provides support for per-column typing and allows for data validation and
    coercion behaviors to be configured on a per-column basis, so as to fit the needs of various
    usage scenarios.

    The following types are currently supported:
    - `numeric`: includes both integers and floats
    - `text`: string, sequence of characters
    - `datetime`: string in the form 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ssssss' or some truncation thereof
    - `any`: any type of data

    Additional types and specialized sub-types will be added in the future.

    By default, the column type is `any`.
    ''')),

    reusable_components.Markdown(dedent(
    '''
    ### Presentation
    The DataTable provides multiple presentation schemes that can vary depending on the column's
    type.

    The following schemes are supported by all types:
    - `input`: a text input field
    - `dropdown`: see <dccLink href="/datatable/dropdowns" children="DataTable Dropdowns"/> for more details

    #### Markdown
    The `markdown` presentation scheme allows for the raw value of each cell to be rendered
    as Markdown. This includes features of Markdown such as links, images, headers, lists,
    quotes, code blocks, and (yes, even) tables.

    The `markdown` scheme is only supported by `text`-type columns, and sorting and filtering
    behaviour occurs based on the raw value entered into the dataframe, instead of what gets
    rendered.

    e.g., if cell `x` has the raw value `dash`, and cell `y` has the raw value
    `[plotly](http://plot.ly)`, cell `y` will actually come before cell `x` when the table is
    sorted in ascending order, despite the fact that the *displayed* value of cell `y` is
    [plotly](http://plot.ly).

    Markdown cells also support syntax highlighting. For more details, please see ["Syntax Highlighting With Markdown"](https://dash.plot.ly/external-resources#md-syntax-highlight).

    By default, the column presentation is `input`.
    ''')),

    reusable_components.Markdown(dedent(
    '''
    ### User Input Processing
    The DataTable provides a configurable input processing system that can accept, reject or
    apply a default value when an input is provided. It can be configured to validate or coerce
    the input to make it fit with the expected data type. Specific validation cases can be
    configured on a per-column basis.

    See the table's <dccLink href="/datatable/reference" children="reference"/> `on_change.action`, `on_change.failure`
    and `validation` column nested properties for details.
    ''')),

    reusable_components.Markdown(dedent(
    '''
    ### Formatting
    The DataTable provides a configurable data formatting system that modifies how the data
    is presented to the user.

    The formatting can be configured by:
    - explicitly writing the column `format` nested property
    - using preconfigured Format Templates
    - using the general purpose Format object

    At the moment, only `type='numeric'` formatting can be configured.

    The "Min Temperature (F)" column will default invalid entries to `None` and display "N/A". The "Min
    Temperature (Date)" column will not try to validate or coerce the data.

    Both temperature columns are using the Format helper object to create the desired formatting. The
    equivalent manual configuration is shown as comments in the code below. One can always see the resulting
    configuration for a given Format object by using ```Format(...).to_plotly_json()```.
