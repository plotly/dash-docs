    "Part 1: Sizing",
    "datatable/sizing",
    "
    All about sizing the DataTable. Examples include:
    - Setting the width and the height of the table
    - Responsive table design
    - Setting the widths of individual columns
    - Handling long text
    - Fixing rows and columns

    The style of the DataTable is highly customizable.
    This chapter includes examples for:
    - Conditional formatting
    - Displaying multiple rows of headers
    - Highlighting rows, columns, and cells
    - Styling the table as a list view
    - Changing the colors (including a dark theme!)
    The sizing API for the table has been particularly tricky for us to
    nail down, so be sure to read this chapter to understand the nuances,
    limitations, and the APIs that we're exploring.

    The DataTable is interactive.
    This chapter demonstrates the interactive features of the table and
    how to wire up these interations to R callbacks.
    These actions include:
    - Paginating
    - Selecting Rows
    - Sorting Columns
    - Filtering Data

    components$Chapter(
    "Part 4: Sorting, Filtering, Selecting and Paginating with R",
    "datatable/callbacks",
    "
    In this part of the documentation, the paginating, sorting, and filtering were done entirely clientside (in the browser).
    This means that you need to load all of the data into the table up-front. If your data file is large,
    then this can be prohibitively slow.

    In this chapter, you'll learn how to write your own filtering, sorting, and paging backends in R with Dash.
    We'll do the data processing with `dplyr` but you could write your own routines with SQL or even generate the data on the fly!

    In this chapter, you'll learn how to configure the table to

    - change the data presentation
    - change the data formatting
    - validate or coerce user data input
    - apply default behavior for valid and invalid data

    The DataTable is editable. Like a spreadsheet,
    it can be used as an input for controlling models with a variable number of inputs.

    This chapter includes recipes for:
    - Determining which cell has changed
    - Filtering out null values
    - Adding or removing columns
    - Adding or removing rows
    - Ensuring that a minimum set of rows are visible
    - Running computations on certain columns or cells

    Cells can be rendered as editable dropdowns.
    This is our first step in bringing a full typing system to the table.
    Rendering cells as dropdowns introduces some complexity in the markup,
    so there are a few limitations that you should be aware of.
