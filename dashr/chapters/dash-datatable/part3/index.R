# DataTable Interactivity

`dashDataTable` includes several features for
modifying and transforming the view of the data. These include:

- Sorting by column (`sort_action='native'`)

- Filtering by column (`filter_action='native'`)

- Editing the cells (`editable=TRUE`)

- Deleting rows (`row_deletable=TRUE`)

- Deleting columns (`columns[i].deletable=TRUE`)

- Selecting rows (`row_selectable='single' | 'multi'`)

- Paging front-end (`page_action='native'`)

A quick note on filtering. We have defined our own syntax for performing
filtering operations. Here are some examples for this particular dataset:

- Enter `Asia` in the \"continent\" column
- Enter `> 5000` in the \"gdpPercap\" column
- Enter `< 80` in the `lifeExp` column

> Note: simple strings can be entered plain,
> but if you have spaces or special characters
> (including `-`, particularly in dates) you need to wrap them in quotes.
> Single quotes `'`, double quotes `\"` both work. [Full filter syntax reference](/datatable/Part9)

By default, these transformations are done clientside.
Your Dash callbacks can respond to these modifications by listening
to the `data` property as an `input`.

Note that if `data` is an `input` then the entire `data`
will be passed over the network: if your dataframe is large,
then this will become slow. For large dataframes,
you can perform the [sorting or filtering in R instead](/datatable/Part4).

## Row IDs

When using transformations - sorting, filtering, pagination -
it can be difficult to match up rows - visible rows, selected rows,
active rows - to the original data,
because row indices may not have their original meaning.
To simplify this logic we've added support for **Row IDs**.
Each row of data can have an `'id'` key, which should contain a string or a number.
If you want to display these values you can include a column with `id='id'`,
but normally they stay hidden.
All properties that list certain rows by index also have variants listing row IDs:

- `derived_virtual_indices` / `derived_virtual_row_ids`:
the order of rows across all pages (for front-end paging) after filtering and sorting.

- `derived_viewport_indices` / `derived_viewport_row_ids`: the order of rows on the currently visible page.

- `selected_rows` / `selected_row_ids`:
when `row_selectable` is enabled and there is a checkbox next to each row,
these are the selected rows. Note that even filtered-out or paged-out rows can remain selected.

- `derived_virtual_selected_rows` / `derived_virtual_selected_row_ids`:
the set of selected rows after filtering and sorting, across all pages

- `derived_viewport_selected_rows` / `derived_viewport_selected_row_ids`:
the set of selected rows on the currently visible page.

Often several of these properties contain the same data,
but in other cases it's important to choose the right one
for the specific user interaction you have in mind.
Do you want to respond to selected rows even when they're not on the current page?
Even when they're filtered out?

There are also properties that reference specific cells in the table.
Along with the row and column indices,
these include the row and column IDs of the cell:

- `active_cell`: this is the data cell the user has put the cursor on,
by clicking and/or arrow keys. It's a dictionary with keys:
  + `row`:  the row index (integer) - may be affected by sorting, filtering, or paging transformations.
  + `column`: the column index (integer)
  + `row_id`: the `id` field of the row, which always stays with it during  transformations.
  +`column_id`: the `id` field of the column.

- `start_cell`: if the user selects multiple cells,
by shift-click or shift-arrow-keys, this is where the selection was initiated.
Has the same form as `active_cell`,
and usually the same value although after selecting a region the user can
change `active_cell` by pressing `<tab>` or `<enter>` to cycle through
the selected cells.

- `end_cell`: the corner of the selected region opposite `start_cell`.
Also has the same form as `active_cell`.

- `selected_cells`: an array of dicts, each one with the form of `active_cell`,
listing each selected cell.

Here's the same example, plus active cell highlighting,
implemented using row IDs. One advantage here is that
we don't need to pass the entire data set back,
we can just pass the IDs.
Even the full set of IDs is only necessary in order to sync with sorting and filtering.
