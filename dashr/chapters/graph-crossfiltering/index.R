The `dashCoreComponents` library includes a component called `dccGraph`.

`dccGraph` renders interactive data visualizations using the open source
[plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) JavaScript graphing
library. Plotly.js supports over 35 chart types and renders charts in
both vector-quality SVG and high-performance WebGL.

The `figure` argument in the `dccGraph` component is
the same `figure` argument that is used by `plotly.R`, Plotly's
open source R graphing library.
Check out the [plotly.R documentation and gallery](https://plot.ly/r/)
to learn more.

Dash components are described declaratively by a set of attributes.
All of these attributes can be updated by callback functions, but only
a subset of these attributes are updated through user interaction, such as
when you click on an option in a `dccDropdown` component and the
`value` property of that component changes.

The `dccGraph` component has four attributes that can change
through user-interaction: `hoverData`, `clickData`, `selectedData`,
`relayoutData`.
These properties update when you hover over points, click on points, or
select regions of points in a graph.

Try clicking and dragging in any of the plots to filter different regions.
On every selection, the three graph callbacks are fired with the latest selected regions of each plot.
The dataframe is filtered based off of the selected points and
the graphs are replotted with the selected points highlighted and
the selected region drawn as a dashed rectangle.

> As an aside, if you find yourself filtering and visualizing highly-dimensional datasets,
> you should consider checking out the [parallel coordinates](https://plot.ly/r/parallel-coordinates-plot/) chart type.

### Current Limitations
There are a few limitations in graph interactions right now.
- It is not currently possible to customize the style of the hover interactions or the select box.
This issue is being worked on in
[Customized Click, Hover, and Selection Styles or Traces #1847](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/1847).
