  Elements in Cytoscape are designed to be clear, simple and
  declarative. This chapter will get you started with examples
  for:
  - Data and position named lists
  - Mutability properties
  - Defining groups and classes
  - Compound nodes

  "Part 2: Layout",
  "cytoscape/layout",
  "
  Make your graphs interpretable by using the built-in collection of easy-to-modify
  layouts. We show you how to:
  * Display pre-determined and random layouts
  * Represent your graph as a circle, a grid or a tree
  * Finetune your representations by modifying the default options
  * Use physics-based simulations to generate your layout
  "

  components$Chapter(
  "Part 3: Styling",
  "cytoscape/styling",
  "
  Modify the color, shape and style of your elements with a syntax similar to CSS.
  Cytoscape includes a wide variety of properties, equiping you with everything you
  need to display your graphs with aesthetics, creativity, and understandability in
  mind. This chapter covers:
  * Basic style properties for nodes and edges
  * Using selectors to modify specific groups of elements
  * Organize your edges with curve and line properties
  * Advanced node styling with pie charts and images
  "
  ),
  components$Chapter(
  "Part 4: Dash Callbacks",
  "cytoscape/callbacks",
  "
  Update your layout, elements, or style with other Dash components using callbacks.
  This chapter covers:
  * Adding and removing elements
  * Modifying the layout and the stylesheet
  * Advanced usage of callbacks
  "

  components$Chapter(
  "Part 5: Event Callbacks for User Interactions",
  "cytoscape/events",
  "
  Dash Cytoscape fires callbacks whenever the user interact with the graph you created,
  which can be used to update the graph itself, or to interact with other components.
  This chapter includes examples for:
  * Simple integrations with HTML components
  * Different types of data returned
  * Node versus edges callbacks
  * Tap, hover or select callbacks

  In the near future, we would like to support integration with some graphing packages,
  expand object-oriented declarations, and offer more support for layout options. Check
  out our [open issues](https://github.com/plotly/dash-cytoscape/issues) for more details.

  The development for this component was sponsored by one of our commercial partners.
