In the previous chapter on [basic Dash callbacks](/getting-started-part-2),
our callbacks looked something like:

In this example, the callback function is fired whenever any of the
attributes described by the `input` change.
Try it for yourself by entering data in the inputs above.

`state` allows you to pass along extra values without
firing the callbacks. Here's the same example as above but with the
`dccInput` as `state` and a button as
`input`.

  #example of one input and two states

In this example, changing text in the `dccInput` boxes won't fire
the callback but clicking on the button will. The current values of
the `dccInput` values are still passed into the callback even though
they don't trigger the callback function itself.

Note that we're triggering the callback by listening to the
`n_clicks` property of the `htmlButton` component. `n_clicks` is a
property that gets incremented every time the component has been
clicked on. It is available in every component in the
`dashHtmlComponents` package.

The next chapter of the user guide explains how to use callback
principles with the `dccGraph` component
to make applications that
respond to interactions with graphs on the page.
