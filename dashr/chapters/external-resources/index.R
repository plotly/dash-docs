Dash applications are rendered in the web browser with CSS and JavaScript.
On page load, Dash serves a small HTML template that includes references to
the CSS and JavaScript that are required to render the application.
This chapter covers everything that you need to know about configuring
this HTML file and about including external CSS and JavaScript in Dash
applications.

## Adding Your Own CSS and JavaScript to Dash Apps

Including custom CSS or JavaScript in your Dash apps is simple.
Just create a folder named `assets` in the root of your app directory
and include your CSS and JavaScript
files in that folder. Dash will automatically serve all of the files that
are included in this folder. By default the url to request the assets will
be `/assets` but you can customize this with the `assets_url_path` argument
to `Dash`.

### Example: Including Local CSS and JavaScript

We'll create several files: `app.r`, a folder named `assets`, and
three files in that folder:
```
- app.r
- assets/
    |-- typography.css
    |-- header.css
    |-- custom-script.js
```

`app.r`
  "),
  examples$local_css$source_code,
    htmlDiv(
    dccMarkdown('`typography.css`'),
    style=list('paddingTop' = 20)
  ),
  
  htmlHr(),
  dccMarkdown(
"body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    color: hotpink
}
"),
htmlHr(),

htmlDiv(
  dccMarkdown('`header.css`'),
  style=list('paddingTop' = 20)
),

dccMarkdown(
  "app-header {
    height: 60px;
    line-height: 60px;
    border-bottom: thin lightgrey solid;
}

.app-header .app-header--title {
    font-size: 22px;
    padding-left: 5px;
}
"
),

htmlHr(),
htmlDiv(
  dccMarkdown('`custom-script.js`'),
  style=list('paddingTop' = 20)
),
dccMarkdown("
alert('If you see this alert, then your custom JavaScript script has run!')
"
),
htmlHr(),

dccMarkdown("
When you run `app.r`, your app should look something like this:
(Note that there may be some slight differences in appearance as
the CSS from this Dash User Guide is applied to all of these embedded
examples.)
    "),
examples$local_css$layout,
htmlHr(),

dccMarkdown("
There are a few things to keep in mind when including assets automatically:

1 - The following file types will automatically be included:
            
  - CSS files suffixed with .css
            
  - JavaScript files suffixed with .js
            
  - A single file named favicon.ico (the page tab's icon)
            
2 - Dash will include the files in alphanumerical order by filename. 
So, we recommend prefixing your filenames with numbers if you need to ensure their order
(e.g. 10_typography.css, 20_header.css)
            
3 - You can ignore certain files in your assets folder with a regex filter using 
`app <- Dash$new(assets_ignore = '.*ignored.*').`
This will prevent Dash from loading files which contain the above pattern.
            
4 - If you want to include CSS from a remote URL, 
then see the next section.
            
5 - Your custom CSS will be included after the 
Dash component CSS

### Hot Reloading

By default, Dash includes \"hot-reloading\". 
This means that Dash will automatically refresh your browser 
when you make a change in your Python code and your CSS code.

Give it a try: Change the color in typography.css from \"hotpink\" 
to \"orange\" and see your application update.

## Load Assets from a Folder Hosted on a CDN

If you duplicate the file structure of your local assets folder 
to a folder hosted externally to your Dash app, 
you can use `assets_url_path = 'http://your-external-assets-folder-url'` in the Dash constructor to load the files from there instead of locally. 
Dash will index your local assets folder to find all of your assets, map their relative path onto assets_external_path and then request the resources from there. 
app.scripts.config.serve_locally = False must also be set in order for this to work.

**Example:**
"),

examples$folderHost$source_code,

dccMarkdown("
## Embedding Images in Your Dash Apps

In addition to CSS and javascript files, you can include images in the assets folder. 
An example of the folder structure:

```
- app.r
- assets/
    |-- image.png
```
In your app.r file you can use the relative path to that image:
            "),

examples$embeddingImages$source_code,

dccMarkdown("
## Adding external CSS/Javascript 

You can add resources hosted externally to your Dash app with the 
`external_stylesheets/stylesheets` init keywords.

The resources can be either a string or 
a dict containing the tag attributes (src, integrity, crossorigin, etc). 
You can mix both.
            
External css/js files are loaded before the assets.

# ## Customizing Dash's HTML Index Template
# 
# New in dash 0.22.0
# 
# Dash's UI is generated dynamically with Dash's React.js front-end. 
# So, on page load, Dash serves a very small HTML template string that 
# includes the CSS and JavaScript that is necessary to render the page 
# and some simple HTML meta tags.
#             
# This simple HTML string is customizable. 
# You might want to customize this string if you wanted to:
# 
# - Include a different <title> for your app 
# (the <title> tag is the name that appears in your brower's tab. 
# By default, it is \"dash\")
# 
# - Customize the way that your CSS or JavaScript is included in the page. 
# For example, if you wanted to include remote scripts or if you wanted to 
# include the CSS before the Dash component CSS
# 
# - Include a custom version of dash renderer, 
# by instantiating the `DashRenderer` class yourself. 
# You can add request hooks this way, 
# by providing a hooks config object as in the example below.
# 
# ### Usage
# 
# ** Option 1 ** - index string
# 
# Add an `index_string` to modify the default HTML Index Template:
# 
# ```
# library(dash)
# library(dashCoreComponents)
# library(dashHtmlComponents)
# 
# external_stylesheets <- list(
#   list('https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css')
# )
# app <- Dash$new(external_stylesheets = external_stylesheets)
# 
# string <- \"
# <!DOCTYPE html>
# <html>
#     <head>
#         {%metas%}
#         <title>{%title%}</title>
#         {%favicon%}
#         {%css%}
#     </head>
#     <body>
#         <div>My Custom header</div>
#         {%app_entry%}
#         <footer>
#             {%config%}
#             {%scripts%}
#             {%renderer%}
#         </footer>
#         <div>My Custom footer</div>
#     </body>
# </html>
# \"
# app$index_string <- string
# 
# app$layout(htmlDiv('Simple Dash App'))
# 
# app$run_server()
# ```
# 
# The `{%key%}`s are template variables that Dash will fill in automatically with default properties. The available keys are:
# 
# `{%favicon%}` (optional)
#             
# A favicon link tag if found in the `assets` folder.
#             
# `{%css%}` (optional)
#             
# `<link/>` tags to css resources. 
# These resources include the Dash component library CSS resources 
# as well as any CSS resources found in the `assets` folder.
#             
# `{%title%}` (optional)
#             
# The contents of the page `<title>` tag. Learn more about `<title/>`
#             
# `{%config%}` (required)
#             
# An auto-generated tag that includes configuration settings 
# passed from Dash's backend to Dash's front-end (`dash-renderer`).
#             
# `{%app_entry%}` (required)
#             
# The container in which the Dash layout is rendered.
#             
# `{%scripts%}` (required)
#             
# The set of JavaScript scripts required to render the Dash app. 
# This includes the Dash component JavaScript files as well as 
# any JavaScript files found in the assets folder.
#             
# `{%renderer%}` (required)
#           
# The JavaScript script that instantiates dash-renderer 
# by calling new `DashRenderer()`
# 
# **Option 2 - interpolate_index**
# 
# If your HTML content isn't static or if you would like to introspect or modify the templated variables, 
# then you can override the Dash.interpolate_index method.   
# ```
# library(dash)
# library(dashHtmlComponents)
# ... # build R6 class
# ```
# ## Customizing dash-renderer with request hooks
# 
# To instantiate your own version of `dash-renderer`, 
# you can override Dash's HTML Index Template and provide your own script 
# that will be used instead of the standard script. 
# This script should somewhere call var renderer = new DashRenderer();, 
# which instantiates the DashRenderer class. You can add this script to your index HTML when you're setting app.index_string, 
# or you could simply override app.renderer like so:
#             "),
