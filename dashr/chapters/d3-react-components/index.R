# Encapuslating D3.js Charts as R Dash Components
D3.js is a flexible library for rendering and animating SVG in the web
browser. It's approach toward rendering content in the DOM is quite
different than React.js, the user interface library that Dash components
use.
By popular demand, we've created a set of tutorials to help you
make high quality Dash components with D3.js. Beyond D3, these
tutorials should also help you better understand how to integrate
3rd-party libraries into your custom React and Dash components.
- Tutorial 1 - [React + D3.js, Guiding Principles](https://gist.github.com/alexcjohnson/a4b714eee8afd2123ee00cb5b3278a5f)
- Tutorial 2 - [Real World Example: Dash Sunburst](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sunburst)
- Tutorial 3 - [Real World Example: Dash Network](https://github.com/plotly/dash-network)
Questions or feedback? Let us know in our [Dash + D3 Feedback Thread](https://github.com/plotly/dash-docs/issues/242)
> Note: Before you dig in too deep into D3.js, we recommend checking out
> [`plotly.js`](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js), our flagship
> open source charting library. Since 2012, we've worked hard to abstract
> away the complexity of data visualization through a standard, declarative
> interface for over 30 chart types. Under the hood, `plotly.js` uses
> D3.js and WebGL. `dccGraph` is the official
> Dash interface to `plotly.js`."
