Dash is a web application framework that provides pure R abstraction around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Instead of writing HTML or using an HTML templating engine, you compose your layout using R with the `dashHtmlComponents` library.
The source for this library is on GitHub: [plotly/dash-html-components](https://github.com/plotly/dash-html-components).
Here is an example of a simple HTML structure:

    If you're not comfortable with HTML, don't worry!
             You can get 95% of the way there with just a few elements
             and attributes.
             Dash's [core component library](/dash-core-components) also supports

    #### Dash and Markdown
    Dash supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
    Markdown is a simple way to write and format text.
    It includes a syntax for things like **bold text** and *italics*,
    [links](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), inline `code` snippets, lists,
    quotes, and more.

If you're using HTML components, then you also have access to
properties like `style`, `class`, and `id`.

All of these attributes are available in the R functions.
The HTML elements and Dash classes are mostly the same but there are
a few key differences:
- The `style` property is a named list
- Properties in the `style` dictionary are camelCased
- The `class` key is renamed as `className`
- Style properties in pixel units can be supplied as just numbers without the `px` unit \n
Let's take a look at an example.
