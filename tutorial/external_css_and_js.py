    ## Adding Your Own CSS and JavaScript to Dash Apps

    **New in dash 0.22.0**

    Including custom CSS or JavaScript in your Dash apps is simple.
    Just create a folder named `assets` in the root of your app directory
    and include your CSS and JavaScript
    files in that folder. Dash will automatically serve all of the files that
    are included in this folder. By default the url to request the assets will
    be `/assets` but you can customize this with the `assets_url_path` argument
    to `dash.Dash`.

    **Important: For these examples, you need to include `__name__` in your Dash constructor.**

    That is, `app = dash.Dash(__name__)` instead of `app = dash.Dash()`. [Here's why](https://community.plot.ly/t/dash-app-does-not-load-assets-and-app-index-string/12178/10?u=chriddyp).

    ### Example: Including Local CSS and JavaScript

    We'll create several files: `app.py`, a folder named `assets`, and
    three files in that folder:
    ```
    - app.py
    - assets/
        |-- typography.css
        |-- header.css
        |-- custom-script.js
    ```
    &nbsp;

    `app.py`

}
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {

}
        '''),
        language='css',
        customStyle=styles.code_container
    ),

    html.Hr(),

    html.Div(
        dcc.Markdown('`header.css`'),

    font-size: 22px;
    padding-left: 5px;
}

        alert('If you see this alert, then your custom JavaScript script has run!')
        '''),

        customStyle=styles.code_container
    ),

    html.Hr(),

    dcc.Markdown(s('''
        When you run `app.py`, your app should look something like this:

        examples.)

    ),

    dcc.Markdown(s('''

    There are a few things to keep in mind when including assets automatically:

    1 - The following file types will automatically be included:

    A - CSS files suffixed with `.css`

    B - JavaScript files suffixed with `.js`

    C - A single file named `favicon.ico` (the page tab's icon)

    2 - Dash will include the files in alphanumerical order by filename.
    So, we recommend prefixing your filenames with numbers if you need to ensure
    their order (e.g. `10_typography.css`, `20_header.css`)

    3 - You can ignore certain files in your `assets` folder with a regex filter
    using `app = dash.Dash(assets_ignore='.*ignored.*')`. This will prevent Dash from
    loading files which contain the above pattern.

    4 - If you want to include CSS from a remote URL, then see the next section.

    5 - Your custom CSS will be included _after_ the Dash component CSS

    6 - It is recommended to add `__name__` to the dash init to ensure the resources
    in the assets folder are loaded, eg: `app = dash.Dash(__name__, meta_tags=[...])`.
    When you run your application through some other command line (like the
    flask command or gunicorn/waitress), the `__main__` module will no
    longer be located where `app.py` is. By explicitly setting `__name__`,
    Dash will be able to locate the relative `assets` folder correctly.

    ### Hot Reloading

    By default, Dash includes "hot-reloading". This means that Dash will automatically refresh your browser when you make a change in your Python code _and_ your CSS code.

    Give it a try: Change the color in `typography.css` from `hotpink` to `orange` and see your application update.

    > Don't like hot-reloading? You can turn this off with `app.run_server(dev_tools_hot_reload=False)`.
    > Learn more in [Dash Dev Tools documentation](/devtools). Questions? See the [community forum hot reloading discussion](https://community.plot.ly/t/announcing-hot-reload/14177).

## Load Assets from a Folder Hosted on a CDN

If you duplicate the file structure of your local assets folder to a folder hosted
externally to your Dash app, you can use `assets_external_path='http://your-external-assets-folder-url'`
in the Dash constructor to load the files from there instead of locally. Dash will index your local
assets folder to find all of your assets, map their relative path onto `assets_external_path`
and then request the resources from there.
`app.scripts.config.serve_locally = False` must also be set in order for this to work.

**Example:**

    ## Customizing Dash's HTML Index Template

    **New in dash 0.22.0**

    Dash's UI is generated dynamically with Dash's React.js front-end. So,
    on page load, Dash serves a very small HTML template string that includes
    the CSS and JavaScript that is necessary to render the page and some simple
    HTML meta tags.

    This simple HTML string is customizable. You might want to customize this
    string if you wanted to:
    - Include a different `<title>` for your app (the `<title>` tag is the name
    that appears in your brower's tab. By default, it is "Dash")
    - Customize the way that your CSS or JavaScript is included in the page.
    For example, if you wanted to include remote scripts or if you wanted to
    include the CSS _before_ the Dash component CSS
    - Include custom meta tags in your app. Note that meta tags can also be
    added with the `meta_tags` argument (example below).
    - Include a custom version of `dash-renderer`, by instantiating the
    `DashRenderer` class yourself. You can add request hooks this way, by providing
    a `hooks` config object as in the example below.


    #### Usage

    **Option 1 - `index_string`**

    Add an `index_string` to modify the default HTML Index Template:

    dcc.Markdown(s('''

    The `{%key%}`s are template variables that Dash will fill in automatically
    with default properties. The available keys are:

    `{%metas%}` (optional)

    The registered meta tags included by the `meta_tags` argument in `dash.Dash`

    `{%favicon%}` (optional)

    A favicon link tag if found in the `assets` folder.

    `{%css%}` (optional)

    `<link/>` tags to css resources. These resources include the Dash component
    library CSS resources as well as any CSS resources found in the `assets` folder.

    `{%title%}` (optional)

    The contents of the page `<title>` tag.
    [Learn more about `<title/>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)

    `{%config%}` (required)

    An auto-generated tag that includes configuration settings passed from
    Dash's backend to Dash's front-end (`dash-renderer`).

    `{%app_entry%}` (required)

    The container in which the Dash layout is rendered.

    `{%scripts%}` (required)

    The set of JavaScript scripts required to render the Dash app.
    This includes the Dash component JavaScript files as well as any
    JavaScript files found in the `assets` folder.

    `{%renderer%}` (required)

    The JavaScript script that instantiates `dash-renderer` by calling
    `new DashRenderer()`

    **Option 2 - `interpolate_index`**

    If your HTML content isn't static or if you would like to introspect or modify
    the templated variables, then you can override the `Dash.interpolate_index`
    method.

    ## Customizing dash-renderer with request hooks

    To instantiate your own version of `dash-renderer`, you can override Dash's HTML Index Template and provide your own script that will be used instead of the standard script. This script should
    somewhere call `var renderer = new DashRenderer();`, which instantiates the `DashRenderer` class. You can add this script to your index HTML when you're setting
    `app.index_string`, or you could simply override `app.renderer` like so:

        examples['custom-dash-renderer'],
        language='python',
        customStyle=styles.code_container
    ),

    dcc.Markdown(s('''

    When you provide your own DashRenderer, you can also pass in a `hooks` object that holds `request_pre` and `request_post` functions. These request hooks will be fired
    before and after Dash makes a request to its backend. Here's an example:

    ''')),

    dcc.SyntaxHighlighter(
        examples['custom-dash-renderer-hooks'],
        language='python',
        customStyle=styles.code_container

    dcc.Markdown(s('''
    Notice the `request_pre` function takes the payload of the request being sent as its argument, and the `request_post` fuction takes both the payload and the response of the server
    as arguments. These can be altered in our function, allowing you to modify the response and request objects that Dash sends to the server. In the example above, the `request_pre`
    function is fired before each server call, and in the case of this example, it will `console.log()` the request parameter. The `request_post` function will fire __after__ each server
    call, and in our example will also print out the response parameter.

    HTML Index Template. Alternatively, Dash provides a shortcut:

    ## Serving Dash's Component Libraries Locally or from a CDN

    Dash's component libraries, like `dash_core_components` and `dash_html_components`,
    are bundled with JavaScript and CSS files. Dash automatically checks with
    component libraries are being used in your application and will automatically
    serve these files in order to render the application.

    By default, dash serves the JavaScript and CSS resources from the
    online CDNs. This is usually much faster than loading the resources
    from the file system.

    However, if you are working in an offline or firewalled environment or
    if the CDN is unavailable, then your dash app itself can serve these
    files. These files are stored as part of the component's site-packages
    folder.

    Here's how to enable this option:

    ## Sample Dash CSS Stylesheet

    Currently, Dash does not include styles by default.

    To get started with Dash styles, we recommend starting with this [CSS stylesheet](https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP?editors=1100) hosted

    To include this stylesheet in your application, copy and paste it into a file
    in your `assets` folder. You can view the raw CSS source here:
