    To deploy dash apps to the Dash Deployment Server, there
    are a few files required for successful deployment. Below is a common
    Dash App folder structure and a brief description of each file's function.

    ***

    ## Folder Reference

    ```
    Dash_App/
    |-- assets/
       |-- app.css
    |-- app.py
    |-- .gitignore
    |-- CHECKS
    |-- Procfile
    |-- requirements.txt
    |-- runtime.txt
    ```

    ***

    ## Files Reference

    `app.py`

    This is the entry point to your application, it contains your Dash app code.
    This file must contain a line that defines the `server` variable:
    ```server = app.server```

    ***
    `CHECKS`

    This optional file allows you to define custom checks to be performed on your app upon deployment.
     [Learn more about the CHECKS file](/dash-deployment-server/checks).

    ***

    `.gitignore`

    Determines which files and folders are ignored in git, and therefore
    ignored (i.e. not copied to the server) when you deploy your application.
    An example of its contents would be:

    ```
    venv
    *.pyc
    .DS_Store
    .env
    ```

    ***

    `Procfile`

    Declares what commands are run by app's containers. This is commonly,
    ```web: gunicorn app:server --workers 4``` where app refers to the file
    `app.py` and server refers to the variable named server inside that file.
    gunicorn is the web server that will run your application, make sure to
    add this in your requirements.txt file.

    ***

    `requirements.txt`

    Describes the app's python dependencies. For example,

    ```
    dash=={}
    dash-auth=={}
    dash-renderer=={}
    dash-core-components=={}
    dash-html-components=={}
    ```

    `runtime.txt`

    This file specifies python runtime. For example, its contents would be
    `python-2.7.15` or `python-3.6.6`.

    #### Adding Your Own CSS and JavaScript to Dash Apps

    Including custom CSS or JavaScript in your Dash apps is simple. Just
    create a folder named `assets` in the root of your app directory and include
    your CSS and JavaScript files in that folder. Dash will automatically
    serve all of the files that are included in this folder.

    #### Embedding Images in Your Dash Apps

    Apps deployed on the Dash Deployment Server are deployed under an app name

    require the app name prefix in the relative path. For example, with the
    below folder structure:

    Dash Deployment Server supports these actions through an
    `apt-packages` file and a `predeploy` script.

    &nbsp;

    We have a collection of sample apps that install common system-level
    dependencies. These applications are _ready to deploy_:

    - [Oracle cx_Oracle Database](https://github.com/plotly/dash-on-premise-sample-app/pull/2#issue-144246327)

    the correct systems paths. To do so, we include the ODBC
    initialization files in the application folder and then
    copy them into system paths in the pre-deploy script.

    Let's generate a file to do this. Note that the file can
    have any name as we must specify the name in an application
    configuration file `app.json`.

    In Dash Deployment Server, Dash Apps are run in isolated containers.
    Dash Deployment Server builds the entire system for each individual app
    from scratch, including installing a fresh instance of Python, installing
    dependencies, and more. This isolation and containerization is great: it
    allows for one app's dependencies to not impact the next app's and,
    from a security perspective, ensures that applications can't modify or
    access the underlying server. One part of this isolation is that each app
    has its own "ephemeral" filesystem. This means that:

    - By default, files that are saved in the app's environment aren't
    persisted across deploys.
    - By default, files (even networked file systems) that are on the actual
    physical server aren't actually accessible to the application.

    &nbsp;

    Starting in Plotly Enterprise 2.5.0, you can map filesystems from the
    underlying server into the application. This allows you to save files
    persistently as well as read files from the underlying server, including
    networked file systems.

    Since this feature has security implications, only directories specified
    in the Plotly-On-Premise Server Manager can be mapped to Dash Apps.
    > Note that in Plotly Enterprise versions before 3.1.0 only users with admin privelges
    > could map local directories into their apps. Please contact `onpremise.support@plot.ly` if
    > you have any questions.

    #### Recommendations

    If you are mounting a filesystem, we have the following recommendations:

    - Try to isolate the data that you need into its own, app-specific folder
    - Do not mount the entire filesystem
    - Do not mount system directories, like those under `/usr`.
    - As per the
    ["Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard),
    folders inside the `/srv` folder would be a good, conventional place
    to host app level data.
    - This feature also works with networked filesystems. Note that this
    requires some extra configuration in the underlying server by your
    server administrator. In particular, the network filesystem should be
    added to the `/etc/fstab` file on the underlying server. For more
    information, see this
    [RHEL7 and CentOS documentation on CIFS and NFS](https://www.certdepot.net/rhel7-mount-unmount-cifs-nfs-network-file-systems/)
    , the official [Ubuntu NFS documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-file-system.html.en),
    the official [Ubuntu CIFS documentation](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently)
    or [contact our support team](/dash-deployment-server/support).

    #### Remove Directory Mapping

    To remove directory mappings via the Dash Deployment Server UI,
    navigate to the application **Settings** and scroll down to
    **Directory Mappings**. Next, use the red cross situated to the
    right-hand side of the environment variable.

    In Plotly Enterprise 2.4.0 and above, you can deploy your apps using
    either HTTPS or SSH. If you are deploying with HTTPS, then you do not
    need to set up an SSH key. Thus, you can skip this tutorial and go
    straight to
    [Initialize Dash Apps on Dash Deployment Server](/dash-deployment-server/initialize).

    &nbsp;

    If you are deploying with SSH then you need to add a SSH Key to the
    Dash Deployment Server. SSH Keys are used to authenticate your git
    session with the server. Deploying with SSH takes a little bit more
    time to set up but it allows you to deploy without typing in your
    username and password each time. Continue below for instructions on
    how to generate and add a SSH Key.

    dcc.Markdown(s('''
    #### Why Deploy with SSH?

    We recommend deploying with HTTPS for most of our users. However, there
    are a few cases where deploying with SSH is advantageous:

    - If your Dash Deployment Server is using a **self-signed certificate**,
    deploying with HTTPS
    [requires some extra, challenging configuration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11621768/).
    In these cases, it will be easier to set up deploying with SSH.
    - If your Dash Deployment Server is configured with **SAML**, then the
    HTTPS method will not work.

    ***

    #### Already Have an SSH Key?

    If you already have an SSH key that you've used in other
    services, you can use that key instead of generating a new one.
    For instructions on how to add an existing SSH Key to the Dash Deployment
    Server, scroll down to **Copy and Add SSH Key**.

    #### Using Tarballs

    To add private python packages to a Dash App using tarballs, you need to
    include the `tar.gz` file in your App's root folder. For example,

    #### Using Environment Variables

    As of `pip==10.0.0`, it is possible to use environment variables within

    #### Create and Link (via UI)

    You can create one Redis instance that is used by multiple apps or you
    can create a unique Redis Database for each individual app.
    To start, we recommend creating a unique Redis Database for each
    Dash App. It will be easier for you to ensure that one application doesn't
    override the data from a separate application.

    &nbsp;

    In Plotly Enterprise 2.5.0 it is possible to create and link a Redis
    Database to your Dash App using the Dash Deployment Server UI.
    Here, you have two options:

    &nbsp;

    **1.** Create a database before initializing an app.

    **2.** Create and link a database after an app has been initialized.

    &nbsp;

    ##### Create a Database Before Initializing an App

    If you haven't initialized an app yet, select **Databases** situated in the
    top navigation menu. Next, select **Create Database**, then in the
    'Create Database' modal, add the name of your database. We recommend using
    a convention like using the name of your application and adding `-redis`
    to the end, e.g. `my-dash-app-redis`.

    Once your Redis Database has been created, you'll notice that it is
    added to your list of databases.

        - `url` - The URL to download
        - `appname` - Your app's name.
        - `secret_key` - Your app's secret key. This is needed for authorizing the pdf generation.
        - `wait_selector` - A string that specifies a
        [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Simple_selectors).
        The API will wait until an element that matches this CSS selector
        appears on the screen before taking a screenshot. This ensures that
        the page has finished loading before taking a screenshot.
        In general, we recommend:
            - If there are no graphs on the page, then embed an
            `html.Div(id='waitfor')` in your `app.layout` or return it from
            the callback that gets executed last. With the id `waitfor`, the
            `wait_selector` would be `"#waitfor"`.
            - If the page has `dcc.Graph` elements on it, then you'll want
            to wait until these graphs have finished renderering. To do this,
            set the `wait_selector` to be `#graph_id .svg-container` where
            `"graph_id"` corresponds to the ID of the `dcc.Graph` component.
            `.svg-container` refers to a CSS class of an element that plotly
            inserts in the graph when it has finished rendering.
        - `pdf_options` - PDF sizing options. These options are similar to the
        options that you see when you print a web page using your web browser.
        They include:
            - `pageSize`: Page size of the generated PDF. Available options:
            `A3`, `A4`, `A5`, `Legal`, `Tabloid` or
            `{"width": ..., "height": ...}` where `width` and `height` are
            integers specified in microns.
            - `marginsType`: Specifies the type of margins to use. `0` for
            default margin, `1` for no margin, and `2` for minimum margin. We
            recommend using `1` and controlling the margins yourself through
            your app's CSS.
            - `landscape` (optional): `True` for landscape, `False` for portrait.

        ***

        #### Basic Example

        This example provides a simple UI around the PDF API. You can run this
        example locally or you can deploy this example to Dash
        Deployment Server. A few things to note:

         - If you're testing locally, you will have to specify default values for your
        DASH_DOMAIN_BASE, DASH_APP_NAME and DASH_SECRET_KEY. You can find them in the list of your app's
        environment variables. See [our doc on environment variables](/dash-deployment-server/environment-variables)

    #### Using Branches

    If you want to try out a new feature or test something different with your
    Dash App but don't want to alter your `master` code, you can create a
    branch to encapsulate these changes.

    &nbsp;

    To view all branches:

    ''')),

    dcc.Markdown(s(
    '''
    ```shell
    $ git branch
    ```
    '''),
    style=styles.code_container),

    dcc.Markdown(s('''

    &nbsp;

    To create a new branch:

    ''')),

    dcc.Markdown(s(
    '''
    ```shell
    $ git branch <branchname>
    ```
    '''),
    style=styles.code_container),

    dcc.Markdown(s('''

    &nbsp;

    Once you've created a new branch, you need to check it out (i.e. navigate
    to it).

    ''')),

    dcc.Markdown(s(
    '''
    ```
    $ git checkout <branchname>

    dcc.Markdown(s('''

    &nbsp;

    If you have created a new branch and are happy with the changes, you can
    add and commit these changes using the common `git add . ` and
    `git commit -m "description"` commands. To deploy these to Dash Deployment
    Server, you will need to deploy the branch into master:

    dcc.Markdown(s(

    dcc.Markdown(s(

    ```
    '''),
    style=styles.code_container),


    dcc.Markdown(s('''

    If you no longer require the branch, you can remove a branch:

    $ git branch -D <branch-name>

    rc.Notebox(s('''

    **Note:** using `-D` will delete the branch and all unmerged changes.
