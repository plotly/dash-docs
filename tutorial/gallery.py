        The first interactive app that you'll create combines a `Slider`

        The `animate` property in the `Graph` component was set to `True`
        so that the points transition smoothly.
        Some interactivity is built into the `Graph` component, including
        hovering over values, clicking on legend items to toggle traces, and
        zooming into regions.

            interactive report. The report highlights several notable
            views of the data and then invites the user to highlight
            their own regions at the end. This method of highlighting
            views is a great strategy for walking your readers through
            your complex analysis.

            The height of the charts was specified in viewport units (`vh`),
            scaling the size of the chart to the height of the screen. It
            looks great on monitors big and small.

            The text in the application is centered and its width is restricted
            to improve the reading experience. The graphs are full bleed:
            they extend past the narrow column of text to the edges of the page.
