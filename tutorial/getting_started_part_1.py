    This tutorial will walk you through a fundamental aspect of Dash apps, the
    app `layout`, through {} self-contained apps.

    '''.format(len(examples)).replace('    ', '')),

    dcc.Markdown('''***

    Dash apps are composed of two parts. The first part is the "`layout`" of
    the app and it describes what the application looks like.
    The second part describes the interactivity of the application and will be
    covered in the [next chapter](/getting-started-part-2).

    Dash provides Python classes for all of the visual components of
    the application. We maintain a set of components in the
    `dash_core_components` and the `dash_html_components` library
    but you can also [build your own](https://github.com/plotly/dash-components-archetype)
    with JavaScript and React.js.

    '''.replace('    ', '')),

    Syntax(examples[0][0], summary='''
        To get started, create a file named `app.py` with the following code:
    '''),
    dcc.Markdown('''
    Run the app with

    ```
    $ python app.py
    ...Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

    and visit [http:127.0.0.1:8050/](http:127.0.0.1:8050/)
    in your web browser. You should see an app that looks like this.
    '''.replace('    ', '')),

    Example(examples[0][1]),

    dcc.Markdown('''
    Note:

    1. The `layout` is composed of a tree of "components" like `html.Div`
        and `dcc.Graph`.
    2. The `dash_html_components` library has a component for every HTML
        tag. The `html.H1(children='Hello Dash')` component generates
        a `<h1>Hello Dash</h1>` HTML element in your application.
    3. Not all components are pure HTML. The `dash_core_components` describe
        higher-level components that are interactive and are generated with
        JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library.
    4. Each component is described entirely through keyword attributes.
        Dash is _declarative_: you will primarily describe your application
        through these attributes.
    5. The `children` property is special. By convention, it's always the
        first attribute which means that you can omit it:
        `html.H1(children='Hello Dash')` is the same as `html.H1('Hello Dash')`.
        Also, it can contain a string, a number, a single component, or a
        list of components.
    6. The fonts in your application will look a little bit different than
        what is displayed here. This application is using a
        custom CSS stylesheet to modify the default styles of the elements.
        You can learn more in the [css tutorial](/external-resources),
        but for now you can initialize your app with
    ```
    external_stylesheets = ['https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css']

    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)
    ```
    to get the same look and feel of these examples.

### Making your first change

**New in dash 0.30.0 and dash-renderer 0.15.0**

Dash includes "hot-reloading", this features is activated by default when
you run your app with `app.run_server(debug=True)`. This means that Dash
will automatically refresh your browser when you make a change in your code.

Give it a try: change the title "Hello Dash" in your application or change the `x` or the `y` data. Your app should auto-refresh with your change.

> Don't like hot-reloading? You can turn this off with `app.run_server(dev_tools_hot_reload=False)`.
> Learn more in [Dash Dev Tools documentation](/devtools) Questions? See the [community forum hot reloading discussion](https://community.plot.ly/t/announcing-hot-reload/14177).

#### More about HTML

The `dash_html_components` library contains a component class for every
HTML tag as well as keyword arguments for all of the HTML arguments.

    '''.replace('    ', '')),

    Syntax(examples[1][0], summary='''
        Let's customize the text in our app by modifying the inline styles of the
        components:
    '''),

    html.Div(examples[1][1], className="example-container", style={
        'padding-right': '35px',
        'padding-bottom': '30px'
    }),

    dcc.Markdown('''
        In this example, we modified the inline styles of the `html.Div`
        and `html.H1` components with the `style` property.

        `html.H1('Hello Dash', style={'textAlign': 'center', 'color': '#7FDBFF'})`
        is rendered in the Dash application as
        `<h1 style="text-align: center; color: #7FDBFF">Hello Dash</h1>`.

        There are a few important differences between the `dash_html_components`
        and the HTML attributes:

        1. The `style` property in HTML is a semicolon-separated string. In Dash,
           you can just supply a dictionary.
        2. The keys in the `style` dictionary are [camelCased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
           So, instead of `text-align`, it's `textAlign`.
        3. The HTML `class` attribute is `className` in Dash.
        4. The children of the HTML tag is specified through the `children` keyword
           argument. By convention, this is always the _first_ argument and
           so it is often omitted.


        Besides that, all of the available HTML attributes and tags are available
        to you within your Python context.

        #### Reusable Components

        By writing our markup in Python, we can create complex reusable
        components like tables without switching contexts or languages.

    ),

    Example(examples[2][1]),

    dcc.Markdown('''
        #### More about Visualization

        The `dash_core_components` library includes a component called `Graph`.

        `Graph` renders interactive data visualizations using the open source
        [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) JavaScript graphing
        library. Plotly.js supports over 35 chart types and renders charts in
        both vector-quality SVG and high-performance WebGL.

        The `figure` argument in the `dash_core_components.Graph` component is
        the same `figure` argument that is used by `plotly.py`, Plotly's
        open source Python graphing library.
        Check out the [plotly.py documentation and gallery](https://plot.ly/python)
        to learn more.

        #### Markdown

        While Dash exposes HTML through the `dash_html_components` library,
        it can be tedious to write your copy in HTML.
        For writing blocks of text, you can use the `Markdown` component in the
        `dash_core_components` library.

        #### Core Components

        The `dash_core_components` includes a set of higher-level components like
        dropdowns, graphs, markdown blocks, and more.

        Like all Dash components, they are described entirely declaratively.
        Every option that is configurable is available as a keyword argument

        ### Summary

        The `layout` of a Dash app describes what the app looks like.
        The `layout` is a hierarchical tree of components.
        The `dash_html_components` library provides classes for all of the HTML
        tags and the keyword arguments describe the HTML attributes like `style`,
        `className`, and `id`.
        The `dash_core_components` library generates higher-level
          components like controls and graphs.
