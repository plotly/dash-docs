    # Dash 1.0

    Dash has been in active development for more than two years. In that time
    we've seen it evolve into a robust framework with a worldwide community of
    users. As we continued building Dash, talking and working with Dash users,
    we developed new features that obsoleted old ones, discovered which
    settings are awkward or confusing to new users, and overall accumulated a
    lot of ideas for how to improve the experience of building Dash apps.

    A lot of these ideas have already been built into Dash. Sometimes they
    require changes that break backward compatibility. When these changes were
    small enough we added them anyway - we're still on major version 0 so
    [SemVer](https://semver.org/) allows breaking changes after all - but
    others we still held back because we expected them to impact too many
    users.

    **Dash version 1.0**, in addition to various new features and upgrades we
    discuss elsewhere, collects those breaking changes all in one release.
    With it we are affirming the maturity and stability of the Dash and
    Dash component API. After making this migration, which we expect will
    impact a sizable fraction of Dash users in one way or another, Dash will
    not introduce any breaking changes unless and until we bump the major
    version again. That commitment includes the public API of the whole Dash
    "core": `dash`, `dash_core_components`, `dash_html_components`, and
    `dash_table`.

    Here are the changes Dash developers need to know about to transition apps
    from v0.43 (the last release in the v0.x series) to v1.0.

    ---

    ## `dash`

    ### `serve_locally`: default `True` and new kwarg
    Previously Dash would try to serve JavaScript and CSS files from public
    CDNs by default, and to disable this you needed to set:
    ```py
    app.scripts.config.serve_locally = True
    app.css.config.serve_locally = True
    ```
    Now that's the default, and that syntax can still be used to disable it for
    each asset class, but if you want to use CDNs for both you can just do:
    ```
    app = dash.Dash(serve_locally=False)
    ```

    ### Removed undo/redo buttons
    The undo & redo buttons in the corner of every app are removed by default,
    but if you want to re-enable them, set:
    ```py
    app = dash.Dash(show_undo_redo=True)
    ```

    ### Removed `static_folder`
    This old `dash.Dash` kwarg has been superseded by the much more powerful
    `assets_folder`. If you want the old behavior, use a custom `server`:
    ```py
    app = dash.Dash(server=Flask(static_folder='my_folder'))
    ```

    ### Removed `components_cache_max_age`
    All assets are served with cache-busting query strings in their URLs,
    so this is unnecessary.

    ### Use `app.config`
    We used to store a lot of app settings directly as attributes, for example
    `app = dash.Dash(assets_ignore=...)` would set `app.assets_ignore`.
    Others would go into `app.config`. Now all constructor args go into
    `app.config`, with three exceptions:
    - `server`: can set later with `app.init_app(server)`
    - `index_string`: can set later with `app.index_string = 'custom string'`
    - `plugins`: can add plugins later with `my_plugin.plug(app)`

    Some config items do not work correctly if modified later.
    These are read-only in `app.config`.

    ### Removed misspelled `supress_callback_exceptions`
    Just use the correct spelling, `suppress_callback_exceptions`

    ### Changed `dev_tools_hot_reload_interval` to seconds
    Previously this `run_server` or `enable_dev_tools` setting was in
    milliseconds, but `dev_tools_hot_reload_watch_interval` is in seconds.
    Now they match!

    ### `debug` smarter defaults
    Changed `enable_dev_tools()` to have `debug=True` by default. Now a simple
    `app.enable_dev_tools()` enables all the dev tools. In `app.run_server()`
    it is still `debug=False` by default, so `app.run_server(debug=True)` is
    still the correct way to enable dev tools there.

    ---

    ## `dash_core_components`

    ### Removed `SyntaxHighlighter` component
    This is now built into `dcc.Markdown` using triple backticks, with optional
    short or long language name on the opening line:
    ````
    dcc.Markdown(\'\'\'
    ```py
    def f(a, b):
        return a + b
    ```
    \'\'\')
    ````

    ### Added automatic dedenting in `Markdown`
    If all lines (other than whitespace-only or blank lines) start with the
    same whitespace, it will be removed. Disable this with
    ```py
    dcc.Markdown(dedent=False)
    ```

    ### Renamed `Checklist.values` prop to `value`
    To match all the other input components.

    ### Removed `version.py`
    The simple way to get version info has always been `dcc.__version__`.
    Previously there was a `dash_core_components.version` module you could
    look in as well, but that has been removed.

    ---

    ## `dash_html_components`

    ### Removed `version.py`
    Same as in `dash_core_components`.
    The simple way to get version info has always been `html.__version__`.
    Previously there was a `dash_html_components.version` module you could
    look in as well, but that has been removed.

    ## `dash_table`

    Lots of properties are renamed and/or restructured for better
    self-consistency and extensibility.

    | Old Prop         | New Prop            | Notes |
    |------------------|---------------------|-------|
    |`column.clearable`|`dropdown*.clearable`|`clearable` is a property of dropdowns, not really of columns. So it has moved into `dropdown`, `dropdown_conditional`, and `dropdown_data`.|
    |`column.deletable`|                     |For multi-line headers, accepts an array of booleans rather than a number. For example, if there are multiple headers and you want the second header row to be deletable, this would be `[False, True]`.|
    |`column.hidden`   |**REMOVED**          |Will be added back later in a different form. Follow [dash-table#314](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/314) for updates.|
    |`column.id`       |                     |Accepts strings only; numbers can be cast to string.|
    |`column.options`  |`dropdown`           |Similar to `clearable`, `options` is a dropdown property, not a column property.|
    |`column.editable_name`|`column.renamable`|Similar to `deletable`, for multi-line headers, accepts an array of booleans rather than a number.|
    |`column_conditional_dropdowns`|`dropdown_conditional`|Still an array of objects, but structure changed to `{clearable: boolean, if: {column_id, filter_query}, options: array of {label, value}}`|
    |`column_conditional_tooltips`|`tooltip_conditional`|Just renamed, structure is unchanged.|
    |`column_static_dropdown`|`dropdown`     |Changed from an array of objects to an object of objects. Keys are column IDs, values are `{clearable: boolean, options: array of {label, value}}`.|
    |`column_static_tooltip`|`tooltip`       |Renamed, values are unchanged.|
    |`content_style`   |**REMOVED**          |Unnecessary. If a use case arises that isn't covered by normal CSS, let us know and we can consider re-adding.|
    |`dropdown_properties`|`dropdown_data`   |Structure changed to match `data`: an array of objects, keys are column IDs, values are `{clearable: boolean, options: array of {label, value}}`.|
    |`derived_filter_structure`|`derived_filter_query_structure`|Just renamed, values are unchanged.|
    |`filter`          |`filter_query`       |Renamed, values are unchanged.|
    |`filtering`       |`filter_action`      |Values changed: `'fe'` is now `'native'`, `'be'` is now `'custom'`, and `false` is now '`none'`|
    |`n_fixed_columns` |`fixed_columns`      |Now accepts an object `{headers: boolean, data: number}` instead of a number. `headers=True` fixes all row action columns (select/delete), `data` is the number of data columns to fix after the headers.|
    |`n_fixed_rows`    |`fixed_rows`         |Now accepts an object `{headers: boolean, data: number}` instead of a number. `headers=True` fixes all header rows, `data` is the number of data rows to fix after the headers.|
    |`pagination_mode` |`page_action`        |Values changed: `'fe'` is now `'native'`, `'be'` is now `'custom'`, and `false` is now '`none'`|
    |`pagination_settings`|`page_current`, `page_size`|Split this nested property into two separate top-level properties.|
    |`sort_type`       |`sort_mode`          |Renamed, values are unchanged.|
    |`sorting`         |`sort_action`        |Values changed: `'fe'` is now `'native'`, `'be'` is now `'custom'`, and `false` is now '`none'`|
    |`sorting_treat_empty_string_as_none`|`sort_as_null`|Now accepts an array of string, number or booleans that can be ignored during sort. Can also be set per column with `column.sort_as_null`.|
    |`style_data_conditional`|               |Renamed nested prop `if.filter` to `if.filter_query`.|
    |`tooltips`        |`tooltip_data`       |Structure changed to match `data`: an array of objects, keys are column IDs, values are `{delay, duration, type, value}` as before.|
