        # DataTable Interactivity

        `DataTable` includes several features for modifying and transforming the
        view of the data. These include:

        - Sorting by column (`sorting=True`)
        - Filtering by column (`filtering=True`)
        - Editing the cells (`editable=True`)
        - Deleting rows (`row_deletable=True`)
        - Deleting columns (`columns[i].deletable=True`)
        - Selecting rows (`row_selectable='single' | 'multi'`)
        - Paging front-end (`pagination_mode='fe'`)

        A quick note on filtering. We have defined our own
        syntax for performing filtering operations. Here are some
        examples for this particular dataset:

        - Enter `eq "Asia"` in the "continent" column
        - Enter `> num(5000)` in the "gdpPercap" column
        - Enter `< num(80)` in the `lifeExp` column

        > Note that you need to wrap strings in double quotes (`"`) and
        > numbers in `num`.
        > We will improve this syntax in the future,
        > follow [dash-table#169](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/169)
        > for more.

        By default, these transformations are done clientside.
        Your Dash callbacks can respond to these modifications
        by listening to the `data` property as an `Input`.

        Note that if `data` is an `Input` then the entire
        `data` will be passed over the network: if your dataframe is
        large, then this will become slow. For large dataframes, you can
        perform the [sorting or filtering in Python instead](/datatable/callbacks).
